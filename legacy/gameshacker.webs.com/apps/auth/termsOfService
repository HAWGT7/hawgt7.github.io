You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree not to use the account, username or password of another User at any time or to disclose your password to any third party or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account. You agree to <a href="https://webs.com/pages/report/" rel="nofollow">notify us</a> immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any breach of security and understand that we reserve the right to take legal actions against individuals who misuse accounts and memberships on Webs.com.
</p>

<h2><a name="fees"></a>3. Fees</h2> 
<p>
Our basic website building and hosting solution is offered to you free of charge. Our free solution is supported by advertising. You will also have the opportunity to upgrade your account and purchase optional <a href="https://webs.com/premium.jsp" rel="nofollow">Premium Services</a> and additional features as may be made available by us, Applications, our affiliates or business partners from time to time. See sections 11-16 below for specific terms relating to our paid services and payment terms.  
</p>

<h2><a name="website_content"></a>4. Website Content Control and User Data</h2> 
<p>
You control the Websites you create using our Services and Webs does not claim any ownership rights in any text, files, images, photos, videos, sounds, musical works, comments, recommendations, forums, listings, logos, trademarks, postings, messages, tags, works of authorship, or any other work or authorship added to or submitted with any of the foregoing (collectively, "Content") posted by you or by Visitors or Members of your Websites. Therefore, Webs takes no responsibility for any Content located in your Website and Webs has no obligation to monitor such Content or your Website. You are therefore responsible for the removal of any such Content that is in violation of these Terms of Service and ensuring compliance with these Terms of Service. 
</p>

<p>
By visiting or becoming a Member of a Website created using our Services, you agree that the Content and information you provide during the registration process (including your email address) and other interactions with the Website may be accessed by the Website Creator and their authorized representatives and administrators, as well as any Application Developer whose Applications run on that Website. Similarly, by adding or using an Application or a service provided by one of our affiliates or business partners, you agree that the Content and information you or your Website Visitors or Members provide in the interactions with your Website as well as that Application or service may be accessed by the respective Application Developer, affiliate or business partner and their authorized representatives. We require Website Creators, Application Developers, affiliates and business partners to respect your privacy settings and our <a href="https://www.webs.com/pages/privacy/" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a>, but your agreement with that Website, Application, affiliate or business partner will control how they can use the Content and information shared with them. Be sure to understand the privacy settings, terms and privacy policies of that Website, Application or service prior to your interactions. Note that Webs cannot guarantee that such third parties will comply with their contractual requirements, and Webs does not assume any liability or responsibility for any third party's actions, or for enforcing any agreements such third parties may enter into with your or with us.
</p>

<p>
As a Website Creator, you and your authorized representatives and administrators will have access to the email address of the Members of your Website, along with certain information, Content and data provided or collected during their registration and use of your Website ("Website Member Data"). Webs may also provide you with access to certain Visitor data that we collect as part of our Services (collectively with Website Member Data and other data you collect, "User Data"). You agree to have a privacy policy or otherwise make it clear to your Visitors and Members what User Data you are going to use and how you will use, display or share that data. You further agree that, as between you and Webs, subject to this Agreement and each User's rights, (i) Webs owns all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the User Data collected by us, and (ii) you own all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the User Data collected by you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for Webs to run your Website on Webs.com, you hereby grant Webs a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license to (i) use, reproduce, store, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly perform and display the User Data on or through Webs.com and in all current and future media in which the Services may be distributed; (ii) use and disclose the User Data and related metrics in an aggregate or other non-personally identifiable manner (including, for use in targeting advertising in a non-personally identifiable manner through and in connection with Webs.com); and (iii) use User Data for other purposes permitted by the Webs Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2><a name="obligation"></a>5. Your Obligation to Protect User Data</h2>
<p>
If you collect or have been provided access to User Data, you hereby agree not to use, display or share User Data in a manner inconsistent with the User's privacy settings, our Terms of Service and Guidelines, and all applicable laws and regulations. You hereby further agree that your use and disclosure of User Data shall be reasonably protective of each User's rights and in no event shall you observe standards of privacy and confidentiality in connection with the use and disclosure of User Data that are less stringent than the standards set forth in our <a href="https://www.webs.com/pages/privacy/" rel="nofollow">Privacy Policy</a>. You agree to promptly delete all User Data (i) relating to any User who de-authorizes, disconnects or otherwise disassociates from your Website, Application or service, (ii) if we disable your Website, Application or service, or (iii) upon request by us or the User. Webs is not required to keep back-up copies of User Data on Webs.com once the Website or User Data is deleted. Webs makes no guarantee that User Data will be safely stored on Webs.com. To be safe, you should independently back-up User Data, to the extent permitted herein and applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge that Webs may terminate the account of any User (including Members of your Website(s) or users of your Application) in accordance with this Agreement.
</p>

<h2><a name="proprietary"></a>6. Proprietary Rights to Content</h2>
<p>
By displaying or publishing ("posting") any Content on or through the Services, you hereby grant to Webs a limited license to use, modify, publicly perform, publicly display, publish, reproduce, distribute, list information regarding, edit, translate, and make derivative works of such Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed for use solely in connection with the Services.
</p>

<p>
Without this license, Webs would be unable to provide the Services. The license you grant to Webs is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your Content to anyone else in addition to Webs), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Webs is not required to pay you for the use on the Services of the Content that you post), transferable and sub-licensable (so that Webs is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors such as Internet content delivery networks to provide the Services), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Services are global in reach). Unless you have shared your Content with others, and they have not deleted it, this license will terminate at the time you remove your Content from the Services, but you understand and agree that your Content may continue to appear on Webs.com or Websites after you remove it from the Services as portion of your Content may remain on pages cached by third parties, incorporated into RSS feeds, User profiles or other features, or archived on servers. Furthermore, when you publish any Content or information using the "everyone" or "public" settings, it means that everyone, including people off of Webs.com, will have access to that information and we may not have control over what they do with it. 
</p>

<p>
When you post any Content on a Website, you provide the Website Creator, other Members of that Website or the public in general with permission to view and use your Content depending on the Website's privacy settings and policies. Be sure to understand that Website's privacy settings and policies prior to posting your Content.
</p>

<p>
You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Services or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, and (ii) the posting of your Content on or through the Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract rights or any other rights of any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of any Content posted by you to or through the Services.
</p>

<p>
If a Website is removed from Webs.com, the Content associated with that Website may also be deleted at the discretion of the Website Creator or Webs. We encourage you to be sure you are comfortable with this possibility before contributing your Content to a Website. You should be aware that Webs is not required and may not keep back-up copies of Content (including your Content) on Webs.com once the Website or Content is deleted. Additionally, Webs makes no guarantee, either during or after the term of this Agreement, that your Content will be safely stored on Webs.com and you should independently back-up your Content.
</p>

<p>
The Webs Services contain proprietary content that is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws in the United States and around the world (the "Webs Content"). Webs owns and retains all rights in the Webs Content and the Services. Webs hereby grants you a limited, freely revocable, non-sublicensable license to reproduce and display the Webs Content (excluding any software code) solely for your personal use in connection with using the Services. As between you and Webs.com, all the intellectual property rights in the Webs technology, which does not include your Content, are owned by Webs or its licensors.
</p>

<p>
The Webs Services contain Content of Users and other Webs licensors. Except for Content posted by you, you may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, archive, transmit, distribute, perform, display, decompile, reverse engineer, attempt to access the source code, create derivative works from, rent or sell any Content appearing on or through the Services without permission of the Content owner.
</p>

<p>
We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions you may have about Webs, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).
</p>

<h2><a name="content_posted"></a>7. Content Posted</h2>
<p>
Please choose carefully the content you post on any Website and that you provide to other Users. You may not use the Services to post, disseminate or communicate any obscene, lewd, excessively violent, harassing, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable subject matter. Despite this prohibition, content communicated by other Users may contain inaccurate, inappropriate, offensive or sexually explicit material, products or services, and Webs assumes no responsibility or liability for this material. If you become aware of misuse of the Services, please contact us by using this <a href="https://webs.com/pages/report/" rel="nofollow">form</a>.
</p>

<p>
Without assuming any obligation to do so, Webs may delete any Content or suspend any Website or account associated with it, that in the sole judgment of Webs violates this Agreement or that may be offensive or illegal, or violate the rights, harm, or threaten the safety of any person. Webs assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Services for inappropriate Content or conduct. If, at any time, Webs chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the Services, Webs nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Content, no obligation to modify or remove any inappropriate Content, and no responsibility for the conduct of the User submitting any such Content.
</p>

<p>
You are solely responsible for the Content that you post on or through any of the Services, and any material or information that you transmit to other Users and for your interactions with other Users. Webs does not endorse and has no control over the Content. Content is not necessarily reviewed by Webs prior to posting and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or policies of Webs. Webs makes no warranties, express or implied, as to the Content or to the accuracy and reliability of the Content or any material or information that you transmit to, or receive from, other Users.
</p>

<h2><a name="content_activity"></a>8. Content/Activity Prohibited</h2>
<p>
The following is a partial list of the kind of Content and activity that is prohibited on any Website and through the use of the Services. Webs reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject, refuse to post or remove any posting (including private messages) by you, or to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without prior notice, and without liability if we believe you are in violation of this provision. Webs further reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, in our sole discretion, violates this provision, including without limitation, reporting it to, and cooperating fully with, law enforcement authorities. Prohibited Content and activity includes, but is not limited to, Content or activity that in the sole discretion of Webs:

<h2><a name="user_support"></a>10. User Support</h2>
<p>
As a Website Creator, you are responsible for implementing and maintaining all support for your Website(s), including answering questions from your Members and Visitors. If you are a Website Creator and have any question with regards to your account, please visit our <a href="https://support.webs.com/" rel="nofollow">Support Center</a> for answers to common questions or visit <a href="https://webs.com/pages/contact/" rel="nofollow">this page to contact a member of our support team.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="premium"></a>11. Premium Service</h2>
<p>
Today, our Premium Services include various options for our Website Creators such as removing ads from your site, using your own domain name, removing Webs promotional links or images, and the addition of storage space and bandwidth. Current categories and prices of our Premium Services are described <a href="https://webs.com/premium.jsp" rel="nofollow">here</a>. All prices are subject to change from time to time. Webs may choose to temporarily change the fees for the Premium Services for promotional or new services, and such changes are immediately effective when Webs posts the temporary promotional event or new service on Webs.com. Any changes to fees for Premium Services that are not temporary or promotional will be effective thirty (30) days after we provide you with notice by posting such changes on Webs.com. The changes shall only apply prospectively to the Premium Services you've purchased. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars.
</p>

<h2><a name="other_paid"></a>12. Other Paid Services</h2>
<p>
In addition to Premium Services, as a Website Creator you may purchase other paid services (collectively with Premium Services, the "Paid Services") which may be provided as a one-time transaction or recurring subscription in connection with an Application or as additional services. Such Paid Services may be provided solely by us or in collaboration with Application Developers, affiliates or business partners. You may be presented with additional terms related to a specific purchase before you confirm such transaction. Those additional terms will also govern that transaction. 
</p>

<p>
Please note that if you enter into a transaction with a third-party, such as by purchasing an item through a Website hosted on Webs.com, and have a dispute over the goods or services you purchased we have no liability for such goods or services. Although we may intervene in disputes between Users concerning payments, we have no obligation to do so.
</p>

<h2><a name="payments"></a>13. Payments</h2>
<p>
You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with the Paid Services in a timely manner with a valid payment method. You authorize Webs to charge your credit card, charge card, debit card, PayPal, or financial institution account (herein "Payment Method") for all charges to your accounts with Webs. When you provide a Payment Method to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that Payment Method. You also authorize us to collect and store it, along with other related transaction information. When you make a purchase, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the Payment Method you designate for the transaction. For Premium Services, we only offer recurring payments; therefore, you agree that Webs may automatically charge the fee to your Payment Method at the beginning of each recurring period. For example, if you choose a Premium Service with a monthly plan, you will be billed every month on the anniversary date of the date you clicked the "Purchase" button. Additionally, we may offer a pre-pay payment option for payment of Premium Services ("Pre-Payment Plan"). If you opt for a Pre-Payment Plan, your Payment Method will be charged the then-current fee for that Premium Service at the commencement of each renewal period. 
</p>

<p>
You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Webs may be shared by Webs with third parties, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purpose of checking credit, effecting payment to Webs and servicing your account.
</p>

<p>
If you pay by credit or debit card we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount up to the amount of the purchase. We will bill your card at the time of purchase or shortly thereafter. If you cancel a transaction before completion, that pre-approval may result in your funds not otherwise being immediately available. If you pay by debit card and your payment results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee. You agree to pay Webs all charges incurred under your account for any Paid Service in which you or anyone else who uses your account (including children, family and friends) enroll in accordance with this Agreement and any applicable Paid Services terms. If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, (a) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand and reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted, (b) Webs may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (c) Webs reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Premium Services or your account with Webs, including deletion of your Website from Webs.com. Except as may be set forth herein, any fees charged to your account are non-refundable. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any charge to your account in writing to Webs within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge.
</p>

<h2><a name="taxes"></a>14. Taxes</h2>
<p>
You are responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of Webs.com, including, but not limited to, sales, use, or value added taxes. If requested, you will promptly furnish to Webs the applicable receipts and/or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable. To the extent that Webs is obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account.
<p>

<h2><a name="money"></a>15. Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://webs.com/premium.jsp" rel="nofollow">Premium Services</a> include a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you are dissatisfied with your service for any reason, you will receive a full refund (minus domain name registration fee and overage charges) if you cancel your paid services within 30 days of the activation of your account. The 30-day money-back guarantee does NOT apply to domain name registration or other Paid Services. Once you purchase your domain name, you are its owner and it cannot be "returned." 
</p>

<h2><a name="credits"></a>16. Webs Credits; Credit Shop</h2>
<p>
You may purchase or earn credits on Webs.com ("Webs Credits") that you may redeem to receive various goods and services through our online <a href="https://members.webs.com/s/credits/" rel="nofollow">credit shop</a> ("Credit Shop"). Even though we may use terms like "purchase," "buy," "sell," and "order" to talk about transactions related to Webs Credits, we don't transfer an ownership interest in those items. Instead, those credits are licensed to you. Therefore, when you purchase or receive credits, you do not own the credits; rather, you receive a limited right to use such credits in connection with certain features and services on Webs.com, such as the purchase of additional storage. Please note that purchases of Webs Credits are non-refundable, and you may not transfer or sell your Webs Credits to anyone. We may change the purchase price for Webs Credits at any time as well as the way that you can use or transfer the credits. We also reserve the right to stop issuing Webs Credits. Webs Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from us unless we agree otherwise in writing. If you leave a balance of Webs Credits unused for prolonged period of time, we may redeem those credits by giving you item(s) from the Credit Shop in equal value. If your account is cancelled or disabled, you will lose any accumulated credits.
</p>

<h2><a name="advertising"></a>17. Advertising on Websites</h2>
<p>
Unless you subscribe to a <a href="https://webs.com/premium.jsp" rel="nofollow">Premium Service</a> (including domain purchases), we have the right to sell, run and/or serve third-party advertising on your Website. If you are a Website Creator, you may place any advertising on your Website other than Google AdSense. If you pay the Premium Service fees to remove our advertising, however, you may then place Google AdSense advertising on your Website. Webs may establish general policies and guidelines surrounding the running of your own ads ("Advertising Policies"). When adopted, any such Advertising Policies will be linked to, and incorporated by reference into, this Agreement and are subject to change from time to time. YOU AGREE THAT WEBS WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF ANY INTERACTIONS OR DEALINGS WITH ADVERTISERS OR AS THE RESULT OF THE PRESENCE OF SUCH ADVERTISERS ON YOUR WEBSITE. Webs reserves the right to include promotional links on Your Website(s) at no cost to Webs, unless you pay the applicable Premium Service fees to remove promotional links. Removal of promotional links does not include removal of required Webs legal notices and links to Webs Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Guidelines or any statement indicating that Webs uses Webs ID for authentication upon sign in by your Website Members.
</p>

<h2><a name="platform_policies"></a>18. Webs Platform Policies</h2>

<p>
You may not post, modify, distribute, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, trademarks, or other proprietary information belonging to others without obtaining the prior written consent of the owner of such proprietary rights. It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA"). In addition, we will promptly terminate without notice the Membership privileges of those determined by us to be repeat infringers.

<li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

</ul>

<p>

If you receive a counter-notice from the applicable User instructing you to replace the allegedly infringing Content, you agree to promptly comply with it to the extent required by law and to forward a copy of it to Webs. Webs may remove any allegedly infringing Content without any liability to you or to the User that posted such Content. In all such matters, we strongly recommend that you consult your attorney to confirm your obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws.

</p>

<h2><a name="subdomains"></a>20. Your Website Subdomains</h2>
<p>
When you create Your Website, Webs gives you the flexibility to choose your own subdomain for Your Website (e.g.," developer" in the example: https://developer.webs.com) (" Website Subdomain"). Webs maintains ownership of your Website Subdomain and grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, freely revocable, license solely to use the Website Subdomain on the Webs.com.

<h2><a name="communications"></a>21. Webs Communications</h2> 
<p>
It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for Service related purposes, to you via email or, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webs in its sole discretion.

If you do not want to receive certain email messages, you may opt out by contacting our <a href="https://webs.com/pages/contact/" rel="nofollow"> support team</a>.

Content from other Users or third parties is made available to you through Websites and Webs.com. The inclusion of any such Content on Webs.com does not imply our affiliation or endorsement of such Content.
